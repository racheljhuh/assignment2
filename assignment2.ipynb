        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "        \n",
        "  This paper is about the importance of tidying data for ease of manipulation, visualization, and modeling, and will outline a specific framework for tidying.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tidy data standard is meant to facilitate the beginning stages of exploration and analysis and make the development of data analysis tools simple and compatible with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  The first sentence is touching on the fact that every data set has the same goal in mind, tidyness that meets a certain standard, but the starting point prior to the tidyness is different for each set.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The second sentence states that although it isn't hard to define the observations and variables for a specific dataset, it's hard to define a definition for the two terms that apply to all data sets because the distinction between observations and variables can vary depending on the context and the type of data being analyzed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  He defines a variable as something that contains all values that have the same underlying attribute, values as numbers or strings, and observations as something that contains all the values measured on the same unit across all attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data is considered tidy if each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are that column headers are values, not variable names, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, or a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because there is a column for every day of the month. 12 is not messy because it condensed the dates into one column, but is considered molten because the element column contained names of variables rather than values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The chicken and egg problem is that you can't have tidy tools without tidy data, but you also can't have tidy data without tidy tools. Wickham hopes that people will not only build on this current framework to find better data storage strategies and tools, but develop new frameworks to make the data wrangling tasks easier."
